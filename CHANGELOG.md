# Changelog

## `master`
- switched to *Go* 1.13 & modules
- removed *Skopeo* submodule: The *Skopeo* project is [phasing out static builds](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/issues/755), so the previous approach of building a `FROM scratch` image for *dregsy* with just the two binaries no longer works. Instead, *Alpine* is now used as the base, and *Skopeo* is installed during image build via `apk` (see `Dockerfile` for version information).
